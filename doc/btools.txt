btools tool suite
==================

What it is:
-----------
It's a collection of simplyfied LSF commands, which provide machine readable output. The executables are linked against the LSF API.
For larger LSF installations, it is recommended to use these tools. If installed at the right place, the LSF information provider
plugins will automatically make use of them. Else they will fall back to the standart commands, and try to parse their output.

Why are there no binariers ?
---------------------------
Binaries for these tools cannot be provided because different sites use different LSF versions, and also the individual 
installations differ quite a lot between sites. Now sources and build tools are provided which sites can use to rebuild these
tools if they wish to use them.

Prerequisits:
-------------

You will need at least gcc and automake/autoconf:

# yum install gcc autoconf automake

If you can build an rpm, you will need as well rpmbuild:
# yum install rpm-build

In addition, you will need to have LSF installed, including libraries and header files. For non-standart locations you may have to update search paths accordingly.

Installing and unpacking the sources:
-------------------------------------
As root, first install the rpm containing the sources:
# rpm -i glite-info-dynamic-scheduler-lsf-btools-2.0.21-1.noarch.rpm

Building the tools:
-------------------
Build the tools as normal user:

tar -zxf  glite-info-dynamic-scheduler-lsf-btools-2.0.21-1.noarch.rpm
$ cd btools
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make 

Installing the tools:
--------------------
$ sudo make install

If LSF is installed via rpm locally on the node, you can do 
$ make rpm
after the configure step, and install the resulting rpm.

Testing the tools:
-----------------
just try 
$ bjobsinfo 
or 
$ bqueuesinfo

Documentation:
--------------
Each command comes with a man page
