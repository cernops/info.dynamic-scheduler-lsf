=head1 SYNOPSIS

runcmdas <command>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

runcmd is a wrapper designed for running external commands with caching. The output produced by <command> will be cached for a period of time which can be configured in 

/etc/lrms/lsf.conf

This is specifically useful for LSF batch query commands, if the cache directory (to be defined in /etc/lrms/lsf.conf) is shared between many host. 
The difference to runcmd is that it will attempt to run the command as ldap user, if it is started as root. The reasoning behind this is that at 
large sites, the cache directory can be shared via NFS if it is accessed from all CEs by the same account, ldap in the case of EMI.   

=head1 BUGS
